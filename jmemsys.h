 *
 * This include file defines the interface between the system-independent
 * and system-dependent portions of the JPEG memory manager.  No other
 * modules need include it.  (The system-independent portion is jmemmgr.c;
 * there are several different versions of the system-dependent portion.)
 *
 * This file works as-is for the system-dependent memory managers supplied
 * in the IJG distribution.  You may need to modify it if you write a
 * custom memory manager.  If system-dependent changes are needed in
 * this file, the best method is to #ifdef them based on a configuration
 * symbol supplied in jconfig.h.

 * The macro MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK designates the maximum number of bytes that may
 * be requested in a single call to jpeg_get_large (and jpeg_get_small for that
 * matter, but that case should never come into play).  This macro was needed
 * to model the 64Kb-segment-size limit of far addressing on 80x86 machines.
 * On machines with flat address spaces, any large constant may be used.
 *
 * NB: jmemmgr.c expects that MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK will be representable as type
 * size_t and will be a multiple of sizeof(align_type).

/*
 * This routine computes the total space still available for allocation by
 * jpeg_get_large.  If more space than this is needed, backing store will be
 * used.  NOTE: any memory already allocated must not be counted.
 *
 * There is a minimum space requirement, corresponding to the minimum
 * feasible buffer sizes; jmemmgr.c will request that much space even if
 * jpeg_mem_available returns zero.  The maximum space needed, enough to hold
 * all working storage in memory, is also passed in case it is useful.
 * Finally, the total space already allocated is passed.  If no better
 * method is available, cinfo->mem->max_memory_to_use - already_allocated
 * is often a suitable calculation.
 *
 * It is OK for jpeg_mem_available to underestimate the space available
 * (that'll just lead to more backing-store access than is really necessary).
 * However, an overestimate will lead to failure.  Hence it's wise to subtract
 * a slop factor from the true available space.  5% should be enough.
 *
 * On machines with lots of virtual memory, any large constant may be returned.
 * Conversely, zero may be returned to always use the minimum amount of memory.
